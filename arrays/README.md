# Arrays and Slices

These are very similar looking and confused me alot. The arrays in go is only there to act as backend for slices. Slices are like list in python.

## Important Points
+ Arrays have fixed len that need to be defined at compile time
+ If you dont define the lenght it is an slice
+ slice are always passed as reference
+ slice can do anything that an array does and more
